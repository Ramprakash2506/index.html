                <pre><h3>CONVERGING BLOCK CHAIN & ML FOR HEALTH CARE</h3>
                    •The power of machine learning in understanding the patterns in data, analyzing and making decisions, has shown its importance in
                     various sectors.
                    •Machine Learning requires reasonable amount of data to make accurate decisions.
                    •The decentralized database in Blockchain Technology emphasizes on data sharing.
                    <h3>SOLAR POWER ENERGY GENERATION</h3>
                    •The main aim of this project to develop a Machine learning model to predict solar power energy generation, considering factors such as
                     weather conditions, site conditions, and equipment performance..
                    •The predicted solar power generation will be used to schedule other power generation sources and to ensure that there is enough electricity to meet demand.Additionally,                     the model can be used to identify factors that affect the performance of the solar power plant, which could lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs
                    <h3>MOVIE SUCESS RATE PREDICTION SYSTEM</h3>
                    •The purpose of this Movie Success Rate Prediction project is to predict the success of any upcoming movie.
                     The front-end involves Html, CSS, and JavaScript and the back-end involves Python. The framework used is Django and the database is
                     MySQL. Created a web development page for this project.
